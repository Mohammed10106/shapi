## Usage

Using Shapi is straightforward. Here‚Äôs how you can create an API from a shell command:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   Change the permissions to make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x hello.sh
   ```

3. **Generate the API**:
   Use Shapi to generate the API:
   ```bash
   shapi generate hello.sh
   ```

4. **Run the API**:
   Start the API server:
   ```bash
   shapi start
   ```

5. **Access the API**:
   You can now access your API at `http://localhost:8080/hello`.
